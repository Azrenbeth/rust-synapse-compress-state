# Compress Synapse State Tables

An experimental tool that reads in the rows from `state_groups_state` and
`state_group_edges` tables for a particular room and calculates the changes that
could be made that (hopefully) will significantly reduce the number of rows.

This tool currently *does not* write to the database in any way, so should be
safe to run. If the `-o` option is specified then SQL will be written to the
given file that would change the tables to match the calculated state. (Note
that if `-t` is given then each change to a particular state group is wrapped
in a transaction).

The SQL generated by the `-o` option is safe to apply against the database with
Synapse running. This is because the `state_groups` and `state_groups_state`
tables are append-only: once written to the database, they are never modified.
There is therefore no danger of a modification racing against a running synapse.
Further, this script makes its changes within atomic transactions, and each
transaction should not affect the results from any of the queries that synapse
performs.

The tool will also ensure that the generated state deltas do give the same state
as the existing state deltas.

## Algorithm

The algorithm works by attempting to create a tree of deltas, produced by
appending state groups to different "levels". Each level has a maximum size, where
each state group is appended to the lowest level that is not full.

This produces a graph that looks approximately like the following, in the case
of having two levels with the bottom level (L1) having a maximum size of 3:

```
L2 <-------------------- L2 <---------- ...
^--- L1 <--- L1 <--- L1  ^--- L1 <--- L1 <--- L1
```

The sizes and number of levels used can be controlled via `-l`.

**Note**: Increasing the sum of the sizes of levels will increase the time it
takes for to query the full state of a given state group. By default Synapse
attempts to keep this below 100.


## Example usage

```
$ synapse_compress_state -p "postgresql://localhost/synapse" -r '!some_room:example.com' -o out.sql -t
Fetching state from DB for room '!some_room:example.com'...
Got initial state from database. Checking for any missing state groups...
Number of state groups: 73904
Number of rows in current table: 2240043
Number of rows after compression: 165754 (7.40%)
Compression Statistics:
  Number of forced resets due to lacking prev: 34
  Number of compressed rows caused by the above: 17092
  Number of state groups changed: 2748
New state map matches old one

# It's finished, so we can now go and rewrite the DB
$ psql synapse < out.data
```

## Using as python library

The compressor can also be built into a python library as it uses PyO3. It can be
built and installed into the current virtual environment by running `maturin develop`

The following code does exactly the same as the command-line example from above:
```
import synapse_compress_state as comp

comp.run_compression(
  db_url="postgresql://localhost/synapse",
  room_id="!some_room:example.com",
  output_file="out.sql",
  transactions=True
)
```

Note: since this library uses Jemalloc, you might get an error of the form:
```
ImportError: /[LONG_PATH]/synapse_compress_state.abi3.so: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block
```
If this happens then try running the following:
```
LD_PATH=/[LONG_PATH]/synapse_compress_state.abi3.so ./my_python_script
```
Or just try disabling jemalloc:
```
$ maturin develop --cargo-extra-args="--no-default-features"
```
